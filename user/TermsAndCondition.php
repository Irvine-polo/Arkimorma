                for the rental of our items by signing up for our service.</p>
            <p>You will provide information, rent dresses and accessories ("product," "products," "item," "items," "rental" or "rentals"), 
                and receive related "services" from Arkimorma through our website as the renter.</p><br><br>

            <p>YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT BY CLICKING ON THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON OR ORDERING THE PRODUCTS.
                IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CLICK THE "I DO NOT ACCEPT" BUTTON AND YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO RENT AND/OR PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS.

        <div class="RentalAgreement">
            <h5><b>Rental Agreement</b></h5>
            <p> You agree that your use of our website in general, excluding rental orders as defined in this Agreement, is subject to our website's terms and conditions of use in all respects. 
                 result, these terminology may alter over time. Any other terms or conditions, whether preprinted or not, will be null and void.
                 You agree and recognize that you are renting the items and that ArkimormaÂ retains ownership of the items at all times. Our products are available for rent to those 
                 under the age of 18, but we only rent to adults who pay with a credit card or another approved payment method. If you are under the age of 18, 
                 you may accept these terms and conditions and place orders only with your parent or legal guardian's involvement and agreement.</p><br>

            
            <p>When the product(s) is/are delivered to your address, regardless of who gets it, the rental period begins immediately. This will come to an end after the rentals have been returned in a satisfactory condition as determined by us. 
                You are responsible for the products while they are in your possession, 
                and you must treat the rentals with care as if they were your own.</p><br>

            <p>If the rentals are damaged, we will inspect the item and notify you of any additional expenses that will be incurred to repair the item. You will be expected to pay the entire present value of the rental if it is lost or destroyed beyond repair, as indicated in Arkimorma's Consignor Agreement. If the merchandise is not lost, always return it, regardless of its condition. We'll be able to see if the rental can be fixed at a cheaper cost than the full present value this way.
                 Please note that you are responsible for all repairs and replacements, 
                 and you will be charged the agreed-upon present value between Arkimorma and its Consignors.</p>

            <p>ArkimormaÂ will not be liable if it fails to perform any of its commitments hereunder due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, 
                such as fire, earthquake, supply outages, other natural disasters, war embargo, and/or riots or acts of terrorism.</p>

            <h5><b> Rental Fee, Late Fee, and Cancellation</b></h5>
            <p>You hereby permit us to charge your credit card for the "rental fee, or Cod method" which will be paid instantly, when you rent a product. A reservation for a product on our website is an order for that product's rental, regardless of how far in advance the reservation is made. Furthermore, you hereby authorize Arkimorma to charge your credit card for the full present value of the product as stated on Arkimorma's Consignor Agreement at the time of your order; provided, however,
                 that we will only charge the present value in the circumstances set forth above in the event of damage or loss.You may cancel your product order, but keep in mind that the full number of credits will only be reimbursed if you cancel 3 days before the rental period begins. We will refund 50% of the cost if it is made 48 hours previous to the delivery date, and 20% if it is done within 24 hours. Credits are valid for 
                 six months from the date of issue.</p><br>

            <p>If the product(s) are kept beyond the agreed-upon Period of Rent without our permission, we will charge you P1,000 per day in addition to any losses incurred by this conduct, such as loss of client/business.</p><br>
            
            <p>ArkimormaÂ must be advised of any changes to the delivery and/or return address, methods, dates, and/or timings at least 24 hours prior to the original delivery and/or return date. For Monday deliveries/pickups, the renter must notify Vestido of any changes by Friday 6 p.m.; if we are not notified before the cut-off time, 
                the charges for last-minute modifications will be P1,000 per day, the same as a late return.</p>

The color and style of the products may differ from the photographs on our website.

A secure shipping address is a location where a person can receive product(s) physically. Arkimorma has no responsibility for merchandise left unattended if an insecure shipping address is provided. You also accept that giving anything other 
                than a secure shipping address may result in delivery delays and additional delivery fees for which Arkimorma is not responsible, but you are.</p>

            damage as a result of theft, inexplicable disappearance, fire, severe stains, or any other reason other than usual wear and tear. Minor stains, tears, missing beads, 
            stuck zippers, and other minor damage covered by the insurance you paid for with your rental of the pertinent product are considered normal wear and tear. 
            If you return a product that has been damaged beyond normal wear and tear, you agree to and pay for costs that include the cost of repairing or replacing the goods, 
            as decided by our discretion, up to the product's current worth.</p><br>
